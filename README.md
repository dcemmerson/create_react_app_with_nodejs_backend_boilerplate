# React App with Node.js Backend Boilerplate
## About
This repo is boilerplate code for Create React App with the Webpack dev server proxied to a Node.js backend for requests.

## How To Use
```
git clone https://github.com/dcemmerson/create_react_app_with_nodejs_backend_boilerplate
```
From the root project directory, run: 
```
npm install && cd client && npm install && cd ..
```
Note: a slightly different command may be required on Windows systems.

Finally, run:
```
npm start
```

The Webpack dev server is now running on port 3000 and will proxy requests to the Node.js server which is running on port 3001.
